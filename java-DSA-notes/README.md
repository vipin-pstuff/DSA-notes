## Things to keep in mind ✅

- don't spend more than 30 to 40min on a single problem 👍
    - means try to solve the problem & everything 
    - then after 10 or 15 min , if you're not making any progress then go to to problem in leetcode , <br>
        there's a `discuss` section & take hints after taking the hints then try to solve it 
    - & even after taking hints , you're not able to solve then look at the solution in `discuss` section 
    - & these all should be done in 40min 

- how do you know that you're understanding that problem which you didn't able to solve 👍
    - so in order to resolve this issue, when you solve a question by looking at it's answers then bookmark it 
        - & come back to that question after 2 weeks or a month & then again , try to solve it again 
        - even then you're able to solve & looking at the hints then at those hints & solve it 
    - after 1 or 2weeks then again come back to that problem & solve it without hints 
    - & look it until that you're not able to solve that problem without hints 

- how to find & solve problems in leetcode 👍
    - don't do questions randomly or in random order
    - & don't keep the end motivation to just sake of solve that problem 💡💡💡
    - `for every problem , do these steps 🔥` : 
        - `STEP 1` : solve it by using bruteForce approach 
            - means worst complexity means the very simple solution means solution is not optimize at all
        - `STEP 2` : then try to optimize it 
        - `STEP 3` : then make a note like what type of the problem used which type of optimization 

- try to see in which topics what type of patterns are begin used to solve which type of problem & how i.e optimize 💡💡💡
    - Eg : if you do array question then you'll find sliding window , two pointer , subarray questions <br>
        so if you do subarray question then in this question , you'll be applying sliding window <br>
        so this is good for your thinking process & problem solving sense & helps to understand <br>
        & at the end , this approach will help which algorithm used in which type of problem 💡💡💡

- & after completing any course of DSA , then keep practicing little by little every day <br>
    like you're solving questions 3hrs of DSA -> 3 * 60 / 30 min = 6 questions & 6 question -> 6 * 30 = 180 questions <br>
    & let's say in 4 months -> 180 * 4 = 720 & it's more than enough 
    - so practice 2hrs & rest of the time do Dev or Open Source -> these are important if you want remote jobs 💡💡💡
    - & Practice is a key
