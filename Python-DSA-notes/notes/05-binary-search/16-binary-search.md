## lecture - love babbar (paid course)

- why we need binary search âœ…
    - in linear search
        - time complexity of linear search i.e `O(n)`
        - when we have an 1D or linear array , then we traverse on each element one by one <br> 
            so where we're doing single traversal
    - time complexity of binary search is `O(log n)` then what `O(log n)` means & why we need binary search ğŸ’¡ğŸ’¡ğŸ’¡

    - limitation or condition where we can use binary search & where we can't use it ğŸ’¡ğŸ’¡ğŸ’¡
