# Array data structure

## lecture 6 - love babbar (paid course) - array

- array
    - why we use array ?
        - Eg : let's say we have 3 variables , we need to find maximum so you'll use like if statement
        - now let's say you have 30000 different numbers , & you need to make variables & find max , <br>
            if you think you'll use while then it's not possible <br>
            because on which you'll apply while loop , so even we can't make 30,000 variables

    - best practices : always store stuff related to same datatype inside array
    
    - how array is stored in memory âœ…
        ![how array is stored in memory](../../notes-pics/14-lecture/love-babbar/lecture-14-7.png)
    
    - how to create array in C++
        ```cpp
        int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
        // OR
        int arr1[ ] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
        // we can create without or with defining size of the array
        ```
        - but if we do this `int arr[5];` then inside that each 5 block contain garbage value
        - or if we do this `int arr[15] = {1, 2};` <br>
            then 15 size contiguous memory allocation will be created & first two blocks will contain 1 & 2 <br>
            but other blocks will contain garbage value or 0 which is dependent on compiler <br>
        - let's say we want to initialize `0` to each block then we can do this `int arr[25] = {0}` <br>
            that's why in most of the time , we'll get 0
        - & behind the scene , base address will be of that first element of an array ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡

    - accessing element from an array
        - Eg : so we access elements based on index like this `arr[2]` , so we'll get value of 2nd index
        - understand how this indexing working âœ…
            ![how array is stored in memory](../../notes-pics/14-lecture/love-babbar/lecture-14-8.png)
            - so formula is `arr[i] = base address + i * size of the array` , here `i` means index of that element
            - means behind the scene `arr[i]` works like this 
                ![how array is stored in memory](../../notes-pics/14-lecture/love-babbar/lecture-14-9.png)
        - Note : whenever we're accessing an array via parameter of a function then define another parameter the size of that array

    - pass by reference âœ…
        - pass by reference concept comes when we're dealing with array or object or both
        - example 
            ```js
            const arr = [3,6,9]
            const arr1 = arr
            arr1[0] = 23

            console.log(arr) // output : [23, 6, 9]
            console.log(ar1) // output : [23, 6, 9]
            ```
            - here when we did `arr1 = arr` then a new array is not created in the memory 
                - inside `arr1` , only `base/starting/initial address is stored` , assume that `arr` array is starting from 100 <br> 
                    so that base address will be 100
                - so when we said `arr1[0]` then means that formula will be applied i.e `100 + 0 * 4 = 100` <br> 
                    & inside memory , on 100th address , `3` is stored , so when we update `arr1[0] = 23` <br>
                    then that `3` will be overwritten by `23`
                - here array is not copied , only `base pointer address` is copied i.e 100 ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡
                - when we say `arr1[0]` then here 2 things happening 
                    - `first` : base address will be stored inside `arr1`
                    - `second` : then we access the 0th index element & that formula will be applied behind the scene ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡
            - means when we did `arr1 = arr` then `arr1` is pointing to the memory address where that array is stored 
                - & here no new value is created because when we did `arr1[0] = 23` then means <br>
                    we're updating the value based on index inside that array (which is stored inside a memory address) ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡
                - here we're not completely updating the array as a whole value like this 
                    ```js
                    let arr = [3,6,9]
                    arr = 2 // here we changed the complete array value to a value
                    ```
                    - we're updating inside that array ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡
            - in pass by value , we actually copy the exact same value inside the another variable ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ <br> 
                & when we update the value of that another variable , then only value of that another variable will gets updated <br>
                not of that previous variable , because both variable are pointing different memory address 
                ```js
                const a = 100;
                const b = 100;
                // here both have same value , but both are stored in different memory address 
                    // so memory address is unique here ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡
                // so for both different memory address block will be created ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡
                ```
            - so when we update inside the array via index number , then computer will update that array via finding the address <br>
                of that array
                ```js
                // when we do this 
                arr[i] = 23
                // then here arr[i] --> will be converted into a memory address
                ``` 
        - so in array or object , if we change/update inside that array or object then that change will happen everywhere <br>
            where you used that array or object

- Questions 

- homework 
    - check this `int [30] = {1};` , now think what'll be stored in each block <br>
        `[1,0,0,0,0,0,so on...]` or each block only contain 1
