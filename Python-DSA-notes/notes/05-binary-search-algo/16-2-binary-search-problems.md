# Binary search algo problems

## lecture - love babbar (paid course)

- here we'll how to apply binary search algo in 2D array
- how do we know that what level of questions we have in binary search algo
    - `1st level` : classical questions (that you just did in 1D array)
        - if you understand those 10 questions then you completed the 1st level
    - `2nd level` : 2D array (we solve catchy questions)
    - `3rd level` : reduce search space (this concept is related to CP) & it contains questions like : 
        - book allocation 
        - Aggressive Cows <br>

        - painter‚Äôs partition

- how to use binary search algo in 2D array
    - `ques` : find the target element in 2D array via binary search algo
        - understanding ‚úÖ
            ![conditions to use binary search algo in 2D array](../../notes-pics/16-2-lecture/love-babbar/lecture-16-2-0.png)
        - approach : we have 2 ways 
            - `1st way` : using linear search algo or brute force
                ![brute force approach or linear search algo](../../notes-pics/16-2-lecture/love-babbar/lecture-16-2-1.png)
            - `2nd way` : optimize approach i.e binary search algo
                - we already know those 2 conditions in order to apply binary search algo in 2D array <br>
                    but if the input question is not fulfilling those 2 conditions then we can't apply binary search algo in 2D array
                - so we can apply binary search algo in that 2D array input in 2 ways like this
                    ![applying binary search algo in both ways](../../notes-pics/16-2-lecture/love-babbar/lecture-16-2-2.png)
                - what will be the algo/steps
                    ![time complexity & algo steps](../../notes-pics/16-2-lecture/love-babbar/lecture-16-2-3.png)
            - how to find that row which contain the target value ? üëç
                ![approach explain : how to find that row which contain the target value](../../notes-pics/16-2-lecture/love-babbar/lecture-16-2-4.png)
                - conclusion <br> 
                    ![conclusion](../../notes-pics/16-2-lecture/love-babbar/lecture-16-2-5.png)
                    ![summary of those 5 conditions](../../notes-pics/16-2-lecture/love-babbar/lecture-16-2-6.png)
            - so we need to apply binary search algo 2 times
            - student's doubts
                - `1` : here in above approach , we're using 2 pointer approach , but i need 1 pointer approach
                    ![student doubts](../../notes-pics/16-2-lecture/love-babbar/lecture-16-2-7.png)
                - `2` : what if we apply binary search algo in each row inside 2D sorted array 
                    - then time complexity is number of rows * log of column i.e `O(n * logm)` üí°üí°üí°
                    - another approach to solve this question 
                        ![another approach](../../notes-pics/16-2-lecture/love-babbar/lecture-16-2-8.png)
                        - check this another approach solution on YT love babbar DSA course
        - DRY RUN
            ![DRY RUN - finding the row which contain the target value](../../notes-pics/16-2-lecture/love-babbar/lecture-16-2-9.png)
            ![DRY RUN - after finding that row , then finding the target value](../../notes-pics/16-2-lecture/love-babbar/lecture-16-2-10.png)
        - code
            ```cpp
            #include <iostream>
            using namespace std;

            bool search(int arr[][3], int n, int m, int target) {

            }

            int main() {
                int arr[3][3] = {1, 5, 9, 14, 20, 23, 30, 34, 43};

                int n = 3;
                int m = 3;
                int target = 34;
                cout << search(arr, n, m, target);

                return 0;
            }
            ```

- advice to become better programmer
    - after finding the approach of a question then do DRY RUN 5 times with different test cases üî•üî•üî• <br>
        & to visualize more , you can print those variables also like this 
        ![visualize the code](../../notes-pics/16-2-lecture/love-babbar/how-to-visualize-the-code.png)
        - so this the basic debugging if you stuck in the code
    - this practice will help you to become better & you'll be able to visualize the code in better way
