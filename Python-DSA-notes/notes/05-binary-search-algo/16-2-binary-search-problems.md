# Binary search algo problems

## lecture - love babbar (paid course)

- here we'll how to apply binary search algo in 2D array
- how do we know that what level of questions we have in binary search algo
    - `1st level` : classical questions (that you just did in 1D array)
        - if you understand those 10 questions then you completed the 1st level
    - `2nd level` : 2D array (we solve catchy questions)
    - `3rd level` : reduce search space (this concept is related to CP) & it contains questions like : 
        - book allocation 
        - Aggressive Cows <br>

        - painter’s partition

- how to use binary search algo in 2D array
    - `ques` : find the target element in 2D array via binary search algo
        - understanding ✅
            ![conditions to use binary search algo in 2D array](../../notes-pics/16-2-lecture/love-babbar/lecture-16-2-0.png)
        - approach : we have 2 ways 
            - `1st way` : using linear search algo or brute force
                ![brute force approach or linear search algo](../../notes-pics/16-2-lecture/love-babbar/lecture-16-2-1.png)
            - `2nd way` : optimize approach i.e binary search algo
                - we already know those 2 conditions in order to apply binary search algo in 2D array <br>
                    but if the input question is not fulfilling those 2 conditions then we can't apply binary search algo in 2D array
                - so we can apply binary search algo in that 2D array input in 2 ways like this

                - what will be the algo/steps
