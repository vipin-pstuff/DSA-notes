# binary search problems 

## lecture - love babbar (paid course)

- here we'll see how to reduce the search space , so in this , if we do only 1 ques <br>
    then same strategy will be applied on every questions to write code & make approach ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡

- till yet , we did questions of binary search i.e classical ques , 2D array <br>
    & we need to do `search space reduction` ques

- eg : of search space reduction questions (which are based on binary search algo) are 
    - `1` : book allocation problem (which is already done on YT)
    - `2` : find square root via BS
    - `3` : aggressive cows
    - `4` : painter partition
    - `5` : EKO spoj
    - `6` : roti prata

- ques : EKO SPOJ
    - https://www.spoj.com/problems/EKO/
        - we'll do this question only then the same technique will be applied on these other questions
        - story questions are like this question  
    - understand
