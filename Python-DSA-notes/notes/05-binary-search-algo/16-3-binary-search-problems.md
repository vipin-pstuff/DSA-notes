# binary search problems 

## lecture - love babbar (paid course)

- here we'll see how to reduce the search space , so in this , if we do only 1 ques <br>
    then same strategy will be applied on every questions to write code & make approach ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡

- till yet , we did questions of binary search i.e classical ques , 2D array <br>
    & we need to do `search space reduction` ques

- eg : of search space reduction questions (which are based on binary search algo) are 
    - `1` : book allocation problem (which is already done on YT)
    - `2` : find square root via BS
    - `3` : aggressive cows
    - `4` : painter partition
    - `5` : EKO spoj
    - `6` : roti prata

- ques : EKO SPOJ
    - https://www.spoj.com/problems/EKO/
        - we'll do this question only then the same technique will be applied on these other questions
        - story questions are like this question  
    - understand 
        ![understanding the question](../../notes-pics/16-3-lecture/love-babbar/lecture-16-3-0.png) <br>
            means that person will set a particular height & cut all the trees for woods
        - questions is saying that 
            - tell the max height when that person start cutting all the trees <br>
                then that person at-least can cut `m meter` of wood 
            - means that person wants to cut all those trees for `m meter` <br>
                & that `m meter` let's say 50m which is given as input <br> 
            - so ramesh will set a height to cut all those tress on same height ,<br>  
                so questions is asking that tell the max height through which when ramesh cut all those trees <br>
                then answer at-least reach at m meter means `>= m` ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡ðŸ’¡
        - doubt : what if height of a tree is less than the height (which set for cutting all those trees) <br> 
            so answer will be `0` 
    - approach
        - `1st approach` : brute force (means doing hardwork & code not optimize)
